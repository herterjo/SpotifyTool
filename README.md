# SpotifyTool

Mainly for my testing and practicing purposes.<br>
<br>
A nice little console app to adminsitrate your Spotify playlists and library.<br>
You need your own credentials from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications.<br>
You can register your own client ID, secret and playlist IDs in config.json to cache them locally.
